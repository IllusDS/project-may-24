If you want to download and run these files, be aware of the following:

- You will need the standard data science packages (numpy, pandas, skicit-learn) to run this.
- I created this in a Jupyter Notebook environment (in VSCode) so if things are different for you keep it in mind.
- You will have to download the files in the link in 'Circumstancial Data' and name them as 'store.csv' and 'train.csv' respectively. Or use absolute pathing. In any case I couldn't upload both of them here because 'train.csv' was too large.
- I have encountered an issue of not having proper cell outputs when copying the data. You may have to clear the cell outputs and run the code again.
